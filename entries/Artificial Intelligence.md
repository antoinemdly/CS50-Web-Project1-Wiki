# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science focused on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and understanding natural language.

## Types of AI

1. **Narrow AI (Weak AI):** Designed for a specific task. Examples include:
   - Voice assistants like Siri and Alexa
   - Recommendation systems on streaming platforms

2. **General AI (Strong AI):** A theoretical form of AI that would outperform humans at nearly every cognitive task. This type of AI does not yet exist.

3. **Artificial Superintelligence:** An intelligence that surpasses human intelligence across all fields, including creativity, problem-solving, and emotional intelligence. It is a hypothetical concept.

## Key Areas of AI Research

- **Machine Learning (ML):** A subset of AI where systems learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed.
  - **Supervised Learning:** The model is trained on labeled data.
  - **Unsupervised Learning:** The model finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data.
  - **Reinforcement Learning:** The model learns by receiving rewards or penalties.

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Enables machines to understand and interact with human language. Applications include:
  - Language translation
  - Sentiment analysis
  - Chatbots

- **Computer Vision:** Enables machines to interpret and make decisions based on visual data. Applications include:
  - Facial recognition
  - Object detection
  - Image classification
